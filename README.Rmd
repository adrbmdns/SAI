Save time and effort by using emend to clean and standardise your data. The emend package is your artificial intelligence (AI) assistant that contain a collection of functions to help you with your data cleaning tasks.

WARNING: validate that the method works for your own data context. 

The default setting has been set so that the results are reproducible and less prone to "creativity", as desired for data processing. The reproducibility is achieved within the same system (i.e. computer) only and not necessarily across different systems.

## Installation

### Large Language Model

You will also need to set up a large language model (LLM), either by downloading a local LLM via Ollama or API access. To do this see [`vignette("setup-LLM", package = "emend")`](https://emitanaka.org/emend/articles/setup-LLM.html).


### Package

You can install the development version of emend like below:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("emitanaka/emend")
```



## Example


```{r}
library(emend)
```

### Correcting order of levels for ordinal variables

The levels of categorical variables by default are ordered alphabetically. This can be problematic when the levels have a natural order.

```{r}
factor(likerts$likert1)
```

A correct order may need to be manually specified like below, but it can be a tedious task.

```{r}
factor(likerts$likert1, 
       levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Somewhat Disagree", "Neutral", "Somewhat Agree", "Agree", "Strongly Agree")) 
```

The `emend_fct_reorder()` function will try to reorder the levels of the factor in a meaningful way _automatically_ using a large language model. 

```{r}
emend_fct_reorder(likerts$likert1) |> levels()
```

### Specifying the LLM

The default large language model and its parameters are shown below.

```{r}
emend_get_option("model")
```

You can change the model to another one (provided that it is available in your system) like below:

```{r}
#| eval: false
emend_set_option("model", model_ollama("llama3.2:1b"))
```

Tiny models (1b) are faster but less accurate. It is not recommended to use them for important tasks.

### Categorise text

Some categorical variables can have simple typos or alternative representations. For example below we have "UK" written also as "United Kingdom". 


```{r}
messy$country
```

While you can manually fix this, again, this can be tedious. We can map this automatically using `emend_fct_match()`

```{r}
emend_fct_match(messy$country, levels = c("UK", "USA", "Canada", "Australia", "NZ"))
```

The function actually works to match a continent as well! Let's use `emend_lvl_match()` to more easily see the conversion on the levels alone.


```{r}
emend_lvl_match(messy$country, levels = c("Asia", "Europe", "North America", "Oceania", "South America"))
```

The above process required specification of all the levels but sometimes you may not know ahead all of the levels. The `emend_lvl_sweep()` function will attempt to clean up the levels. Below it gets most right but classifies "Australia" wrong.

```{r}
emend_lvl_sweep(messy$country)
```

If you know the subset of labels that are correct, you can specify this in the argument `known` like below.

```{r}
emend_lvl_sweep(messy$country, known = "Australia")
```

### Translate

The `emend_translate()` function can be used to translate text to another language (default English). The text can be a mix of different languages.

```{r}
text <- c("猿も木から落ちる", "你好", "bon appetit")
emend_translate(text)
```

You can also try to identify the language in the text. 

```{r}
emend_what_language(text)
```

## Images

We may have some plots (or image) and process these using a multimodal model like `llava`. This image is available as a link [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Ggplot2_Violin_Plot.png).

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Ggplot2_Violin_Plot.png){width="40%"}

We can describe the plot with `emend_describe_image()` function. The image either has to be a url or path where the image is stored. This can be handy to create alt text entries quickly, but note that the description can have errors (as below).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
emend_describe_image("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Ggplot2_Violin_Plot.png",
                   model = model_ollama("llava:13b"))
```

## Dates

When combining data from different sources, inconsistencies in date formats can occur frequently. Reformatting dates to a single format using traditional programming requires listing all possible date formats and can be time-consuming. The `emend_clean_date()` function uses an LLM to standardise the dates to the international standard "YYYY-MM-DD".

```{r}
x <- c("16/02/1997", "20 November 2024", "24 Mar 2022", "2000-01-01",
       "Jason", "Dec 25, 2030", "12/05/2024")
emend_clean_date(x)
```

By default, the function interprets dates in the format "XX/XX/YYYY" as the European style "DD/MM/YYYY". If the dates are in the US style "MM/DD/YYYY", you can specify the input date format using the `input_format` option. 

```{r}
x <- c("12/05/2024", "Nov 15, 2024", "02/25/2024")
emend_clean_date(x, input_format = "MM/DD/YYYY")
```

## Addresses 

When scraping data from websites or APIs, especially property-related information, addresses can present challenges. The `emend_clean_address()` function uses an LLM to standardise addresses into a consistent format and returns an empty value for items that are not addresses. 

```{r}
x <- c("68/150 Acton Road, Acton ACT 2601",
       "655 Jackson St, Dickson ACT 2602",
       "Unit 60 523 Joey Cct, Layton NSW 6500",
       "23/100 de burgh road, Southbank VIC 7800",
       "91 Sullivan pl, Sydney nsw 6600",
       "i don't know the address")
emend_clean_address(x)
```
